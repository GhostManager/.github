Welcome to the GhostManager organization! This organization is home to [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter)
and its related projects and utilities. Like Ghostwriter, the projects here primarily relate to project management and
reporting tasks for red team engagements.

The SpecterOps Slack has a _#ghostwriter_ channel for discussing these projects and requesting assistance. There is also
a _#reporting_ channel for discussing various topics related to writing and managing reports and findings. There is an
active community of Ghostwriter users and contributors in these channels, so please join us with the link above!
